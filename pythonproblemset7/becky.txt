Becky by Shel Silverstein

Becky loves me,
Becky cares,
Becky picks me peaches and pears.
Becky offers me candy and Cokes,
Becky listens and laughs at me jokes.
Becky helps when I get in a fight,
Becky does all my homework at night.
Becky misses me,
Becky cries,
Becky thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Becky is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Becky just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Becky's hand,
In the darkness where Becky usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Becky's gone!
